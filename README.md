# VERSE: Butterfly Rainforest - Florida Museum of Natural History

## About VERSE (Virtual Environments for Realistic Simulated Experiences)

Welcome to VERSE (Virtual Environments for Realistic Simulated Experiences). This project is located around the premise that virtual environments can be a safe space to rehearse and practice skills; especially for people who might find exploring the real-world activities anxiety-inducing and worrying. After all, not all places are attuned to people with neurodiversity.

With this in mind, we have collaborated with our local autistic community to co-design apps that might help enable, and support, access to a range of environments. By working with local communities, we also aim to educate and help to make the ‘real-world’ more inclusive and understanding.

This virtual reality experience visiting the Butterfly Rainforest, like our previous one visiting a restaurant (Piesanos), is interactive (you have to decide how to proceed through the experience) and most importantly co-created and co-designed with the autistic community. We see no value in designing these experiences without this vital input that includes autistic voice in defining the challenges the community can face, in addition to employing and featuring autistic input through-out a design and development. Therefore, we are very grateful to Jacob Warshofsky for his input and expert insights that led to our VR experiences. Further research will follow, but for now enjoy this free VR experience.

You can use VERSE on a web-browser, or an android phone coupled with a google cardboard VR headset. If you require one of these headsets please contact us and we will mail one out to you (for free too). You can then use this with your android phone and enjoy an immersive experience.

## VERSE Co-Design Process
Our process aims to unite all perspectives to create an interactive virtual museum experience that is engaging and accessible and supports how autistic participants naturally interacted in the exhibit space.

### VERSE Collaborators & Roles
* **Science education expert:** Ensures learning goals are met and participant voices are being centered. Documents co-design sessions.
* **Exhibit designers:** Facilitate filming at the museum. Provide digital assets from the exhibit.
* **Local autistic community:** Explore museum while being observed. Engage in co-design sessions.

### Our Role as Educational Technology Experts
* Unite all perspectives in the build, centering the user and the info from co-design sessions.
* Capture museum experience.
* Implement digital assets from exhibit.
* Develop interactive experience and ensure accessibility.

## VERSE Impact
* Guide participants’ engagement in the physical exhibit through cues in the virtual museum experience.
* Empower participants to explore areas they previously might have avoided.
* With the Florida Museum of Natural History having been closed for renovations (reopening expected 2026), the VERSE immersions have provided a unique way to experience parts of the museum.

## Equitable Learning Technology Lab (ELTL)
The Equitable Learning Technology Lab (ELTL) focuses on collaborative opportunities and a critical discourse to enable greater connections with our community to co-design research for equitable and advanced technologies. Our aim is to bolster inclusion and provide solutions to real-world problems with cutting-edge learning technologies.
